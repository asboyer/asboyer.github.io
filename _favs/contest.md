JACKBOYS 2 was billed as a collaborative project meant to showcase the roster’s talent, a label-wide moment to shine. Instead, it feels like a mid-tier Travis Scott album padded with cameos from friends. I’ll save the full album breakdown for later, but it’s worth noting that this track is one of only two SoFaygo features, despite him being signed to JACKBOYS for nearly five years without a single meaningful Travis co-sign, until this album.

The song runs far too long. No “rage” track should be pushing three minutes, and this one drags past 4:30. A big reason is Travis overstaying his welcome — Faygo doesn’t even make his entrance until the two-minute mark. When he does, it’s the only real breath of fresh air: lively, distinct, and criminally underutilized. Travis, meanwhile, turns in weak bars and a flat vocal performance; “came up off some riddles” might be the laziest line on the entire project. This would have worked far better as a SoFaygo track featuring Travis, not the other way around. To top it off, the beat sounds like it was pulled straight from Yeat’s 2022 run — which makes it feel about three years too late.

Fortunately, I have a soft spot for anything that sounds like 2022 Yeat, and Faygo’s voice can make almost anything sound good. That combination makes this easily my favorite song on the project — one that’s given me plenty of replay value, even if I’m just skipping straight to Faygo’s part. (It’s at 2:02, by the way.)
