  This book is a must-read for anyone interested in the intersection of technology and crime. Andy Greenberg does a fantastic job of weaving together the stories of the people behind the world's most notorious hacks and the technologies that enable them. The book is a thrilling read that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.

  I like it because its _so_ good.

Being able to read this book was a pleasure.

My biggest take a way is that the world of cybercrime is a lot more complex than I had previously thought. The book does a great job of breaking down the different types of cybercrime and the motivations behind them. It also does a great job of explaining the technologies that enable these crimes and the people behind them.
