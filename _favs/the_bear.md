I'd heard a lot of praise about this show, and had seen a few clips, but really had no idea what it would be when I started it. The first season was masterful in the way it set the scene, developed the characters, and came to a resolution/full-circle moment.

The second season was just as good as the first, if not a little better. The sets and production value were on another level, although the character development wasn't as good as the first season. However, the acting, especially from the leads, was exceptional.

The third season is where I started to have some problems. This show is a drama, yet they leave in these characters and scenes that have nothing to do with the actual core plot of the show. It's speculated this is done so they can qualify this show as a "comedy". If that's true, it's pretty dumb, because they are sacrificing the artistic integrity of the show for some cheap bits. I started to just tune out of those scenes halfway through. Also I didn't care about the sister's arc at all, which they spent a good bit on in the third season.

If this show were just the first two seasons, it would be in the high 8s, low 9s for me. The third season just brings it down unfortunately.

Overall, the first two seasons were good, the third season mediocre. This seems to be the general consensus too. Not sure if I will tune in for the next season.
