`jekyll-archives` is annoying. While I think it does a lot of great things, it is missing a key functionality that would make it awesome.

Right now, the way `jekyll-archives` works is you can add the following archive categories to your `_config.yml`. Here is what the [documentation](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-archives/blob/master/docs/configuration.md) suggests:

```yml
jekyll-archives:
  enabled: []
  layout: archive
  permalinks:
    year: "/:year/"
    month: "/:year/:month/"
    day: "/:year/:month/:day/"
    tag: "/tag/:name/"
    category: "/category/:name/"
```

My own configuration is very similar, following the docs percisely:

```yml
jekyll-archives:
  enabled: [year, tags, categories]
  layouts:
    year: archive-year
    tag: archive-tag
    category: archive-category
  permalinks:
    year: "/blog/:year/"
    tag: "/blog/tag/:name/"
    category: "/blog/category/:name/"
```

Pretty simple right? Wrong.

I thought it would be a good idea to add a custom category, `authors`. While its just me writing on the blog, I wanted to be able to support other authors writing on the blog, and then being able to filter posts by author.

In my head, I thought the following would easily add an `authors` category [^1].

```yml
jekyll-archives:
  enabled: [year, tags, categories, authors]
  layouts:
    year: archive-year
    tag: archive-tag
    category: archive-category
    author: archive-author
  permalinks:
    year: "/blog/:year/"
    tag: "/blog/tag/:name/"
    category: "/blog/category/:name/"
    author: "/blog/author/:name/"
```

After adding this to `_conig.yml`, I encountered no errors in running the site, and I began setting up my `blog.md` file to begin solidyfing the authors functionality. However, when I visited the `/blog/author/andrew-boyer` location, it did not exist! [^2].

I came to the frustrating realization that those fields are hardcoded into the library and custom categories cannot be added. Seems like it would be a simple thing to do?

{% custom_highlight ruby linenos start_line=5 %}
DEFAULTS = {
  "layout"     => "archive",
  "enabled"    => [],
  "permalinks" => {
    "year"     => "/:year/",
    "month"    => "/:year/:month/",
    "day"      => "/:year/:month/:day/",
    "tag"      => "/tag/:name/",
    "category" => "/category/:name/",
  },
}.freeze
{% endcustom_highlight %}

<hr>

[^1]: I made sure to make the respective `archive-author.liquid` file in `_layouts`
[^2]: And yes, I made sure to include the `andrew-boyer` in the `authors` field in my `.md` file
