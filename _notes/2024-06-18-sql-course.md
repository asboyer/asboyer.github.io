Notes from [SQL Tutorial - Full Database Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY)

#### What is a Database (DB)?
- a collection of related information
- databases can be stored in different ways

Computers + Databases = <3
: computers are great at keeping track of large amounts of information

Database management Systems (DBMS)
: a special software program that helps users create and maintain a database
* makes it easy to manage large amounts of information
* handles security, backups, imports/exports, concurrency[^1]
* interact with software applications, ex: programming languages

Amazon will tell the database management system to alter the database

#### **C.R.U.D**: Create, Read, Update, Delete
* Creating new entries
* Retrieving
* Updating
* Deleting

Core 4 operations \
Any good DBMS can do these things

#### Two types of Databases
* **Relational databases (SQL)**
    * organize data into one or more tables
    * a unique key identifies each row
* **Non-Relational databases (noSQL)**
    * organize data in anything but a table 
    * key value stores
    * documents
    * `json`, `xml`, graphs

#### **Relational databases**
![image](/assets/img/notes/relational.png)

Can use a relational database management system (RDBMS)
* helps users create and maintain a relational database
* ex: mySQL, Oracle, postgreSQL, etc.

#### Structured Query Language (SQL)
* standardized lang for interacting with RDBMS
* used to perform CRUD operations
* define tables and structures
* SQL code used on one RDBMS may not be usable on another

SQL is the standard in relational databases

#### **Non relational**
![image](/assets/img/notes/non_relational.png)

Management systems:
* MongoDB, firebase, etc.
* implementation specific -> no standard language

#### Database queries
Queries
: are requests made to the database management system for specific information \
As the structure becomes more complex, it becomes more difficult to get specific pieces of information

---

Tables
: Have columns, rows

Columns
: categories

Rows
: a single entry

Primary key
: uniquely defines a row

![image](/assets/img/notes/primary_key.png)
How to discern between the Jacks?

*Primary key* is different. *Always* going to be unique for each row in the table

Can be anything (str, int, etc.), as long as its unique

#### Types of Primary keys

1. Surrogate key
: key that has no mapping to anything in real world (random)

2. Natural key
: ex: social security number

3. Foreign key
: stores the primary key of a row in another database table

#### Foreign key example:
`branch_id` maps to a row in the **Branch** database
![image](/assets/img/notes/foreign_key_1.png)
![image](/assets/img/notes/foreign_key_2.png)

**Note**: can have multiple foreign keys \
Can also use foreign key to map to another row in the same table \
Can define a **composite key** to define a key that uses multiple columns to combine to make a primary key. \
ie: two columns uniquely defining a row to make a primary key

### SQL Basics
Not technically a programming language
Language used for interacting with relational database management systems

SQL
: structured query language

There are different "flavors" SQL \
Sometimes different depending on the management system

#### 4 aspects
Data Query language (DQL)
: used to get data already stored

Data definition language (DDL)
: define layout, schema

Data control language (DCL)
: used for controlling access to the data in the database

Data manipulation language (DML)
: used for inserting, updating, deleting data from the databases

#### Queries
Goal is to only get the data you need \
Often hidden in a complex schema \
Tell RDBMS what information you want and it will give it back to you

```sql
SELECT employee.name, employee.age
FROM employee
WHERE employee.salary > 3000;
```

---

#### [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) installation
Install, set up and start server

```bash
$ echo "export PATH=/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bash_profile
```
^ appends mysql path to path accessible by bash command line [^2]

```bash
$ mysql -u root -p
```
^ enter password (logs into mysql as root)

```mysql
create database giraffe;
```

---

#### Data types
-> using [popSQL](https://popsql.com/download) for visualization purposes

```sql
INT -- WHOLE NUMBERS
DECIMAL(M, N) -- DECIMAL NUMBERS (M - TOTAL NUM OF DIGITS) (N - NUM DIGITS AFTER DECIMAL POINT)
VARCHAR(1) -- STRING OF TEXT OF LENGTH 1
BLOB -- BINARY LARGE OBJECT, STORES LARGE DATA
DATE -- 'YYYY-MM-DD' 
TIMESTAMP -- 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' USED FOR RECORDING WHEN THINGS HAPPEN
```

#### Creating tables
```sql 
CREATE TABLE -- convention is to use all caps for reserve words
```

Trying to create this table:
![image](/assets/img/notes/primary_key.png)

```sql
CREATE TABLE student (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(20), -- ALLOCATE FOR STORING A NAME
    major VARCHAR(20)
); -- ALL COMMANDS SHOULD END IN ';'
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE student (
    student_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(20),
    major VARCHAR(20),
    PRIMARY KEY(student_id) -- can also define primary key like this
);

DESCRIBE student; -- prints the table you made
```

**NOTE**: that if you want to run this in the command line:
```bash
$ USE giraffe; DESCRIBE student;
```
I will be writing these commands in popSQL, but it is good to know how to run thing in the terminal 

#### Delete and modify a table
```sql
DROP TABLE student; -- deletes the table

ALTER TABLE student ADD gpa DECIMAL(3, 2); -- add a row for gpa
                                           -- 3 digits, 2 after the
                                           -- decimal point
ALTER TABLE student DROP COLUMN gpa; -- drops the gpa column
```

#### inserting data

```sql
INSERT INTO student VALUES(1, 'Jack', 'Biology'); -- insert information into table
                                -- insert in the order table was created

SELECT * FROM student; -- gives us all info from student table

INSERT INTO student(student_id, name) VALUES(2, 'Lucas');
-- leaves major null and allows you to insert the known values
```
**NOTE**: you can't insert duplicate entries

#### creating tables for ease of insertion
```sql
CREATE TABLE student (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- name can't be null
    major VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE -- major has to be unique
); 
```
`PRIMARY KEY` is both `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE`

setting a default value and auto incrementing
```sql
CREATE TABLE student (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, -- data inserted will auto increment
                                               -- starting from 1 
    name VARCHAR(20),
    major VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'undecided' -- default value
);

INSERT INTO student(name) VALUES('Jack'); 
-- values for id: 1, major: undecided
```

#### Updating and deleting tables

```sql
UPDATE student
SET major = 'Bio'
WHERE major = 'Biology'
;
```
**Comparison ops**
- `=` equals
- `<>` not equals
- `<` less than
- `>=` greater than or equal
- `<=` less than or equals 

```sql
-- updating
UPDATE STUDENT
SET major = 'Biochemistry'
WHERE major = 'Bio' OR major = 'Chemistry'
;

UPDATE STUDENT
SET name = 'Tom', major = 'undecided'
WHERE student_id = 1;
;
--- without WHERE, all students are affected

-- deleting
DELETE FROM student
WHERE student_id = 5
;
```

#### Basic Queries
Get specific entries from the relational database management system

```sql
SELECT * FROM STUDENT; -- selecting 'all information'
SELECT name FROM STUDENT; -- get just the names
SELECT name, major FROM STUDENT; -- get both names and majors
--- can also be written as
SELECT student.name, student.major;

-- displays students ordered by name
SELECT *
FROM STUDENT
ORDER BY name;

-- displays in ascending order
SELECT *
FROM STUDENT
ORDER BY name ASC;

-- displays order from major first, then name
SELECT *
FROM STUDENT
ORDER BY major, name;

-- only gives 2 results
SELECT *
FROM student
LIMIT 2;

-- use WHERE to specify
SELECT name, major
FROM student
WHERE major = 'Chemistry' OR name == 'Lucas';

-- comparison operators:
-- <, >, <=, >=, =, <>, AND, OR

-- use set of data to filter 
SELECT *
FROM STUDENT
WHERE name IN ('Kaden', 'Lucas', 'Quin') and student_id > 2;
```

#### Complex schema
Moving on from basics and core concepts, moving towards applicable examples
