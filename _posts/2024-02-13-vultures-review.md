### <u>Background</u>
After Kanye's meltdown last year, I highly doubted we would ever get another album for him. But, I believed the only way he could make any kind of comeback was through music. Put down the microphone, stop talking about politics and conspiracy theories, and go back to the studio and lock in. A couple months ago when we first got reports that Kanye was working on a new album with frequent collaborator Ty Dolla $ign, I was skeptical. About half the albums that Kanye works on, and even announces, have been scrapped. Even after they released a single for the project, I thought there would be a high likelihood the album would never see the light of day. Rather than torturing myself by following an endless album rollout, I decided that I wouldn't get my hopes up.

However, after a few listening parties and false release dates (in typical Kanye fashion), it appeared that there would be a real possibility this album would release. I had a few audio files saved to my phone taken from the listening parties, and I liked what I heard. But obviously what was heard at listening parties and what was actually released differed slightly on some songs, and some songs sounded completely different.

Kanye did the same thing with Donda, pulling the curtain back on the creative process behind his albums and showing the fans the evolution of the album through multiple listening parties. However, it does leave more room for critique because fans can reference every version of the song and see which one was better. For Donda, Kanye took the better (fan favorite) version of each song and put them on the album. With Vultures, it was a bit all over the place, and when I get into the meat of the review, I will reference a few previous versions of other songs. Of course, I've learned the lesson to not get attached to any song until its on streaming platforms for more than a week. 

Well, the album dropped a little over a week ago, I've had a good amount of time to sit with it. Of course, that's between the different alterations that has been made to it, the album being removed for streaming services multiple times, and one of my favorite songs off the initial release being completely removed. 

### <u>The Good</u>
First things off, this album has a lot of great moments. Kanye is an expert at crafting spectacles through experimental production and well placed features. You could argue he is one of the curators in all of music.

Ty Dolla $ign hardly misses a single performance. He gives each track exactly what it needs from him, whether that's a hook, verse, or even backing vocals. Kanye and Ty Dolla $ign have always been a great duo and their chemistry really shows throughout the project.

While in my opinion there are only one or two <i>great</i> songs on this album, a lot of the tracks have some cool moments. I love the harmony on the opener, [STARS](https://open.spotify.com/track/347AQK5Lyhn6RvB8tBGYxt?si=2ae875c9e4814851), over the gospel infused production. The instrumental of [PAID](https://open.spotify.com/track/2y4ZR0BUAVePljHSsZyIgj?si=3a66eb926cc44653) paired with the Ty Dolla Hook and Charlie Wilson outro are awesome. The production on [TALKING](https://open.spotify.com/track/1eaqMiiUn2P7MnqJK4XeK0?si=a1c33ab7acc84e33) is spectacular, as with [BACK TO ME](https://open.spotify.com/track/1icgLGTpX2fQXKRe4D7w2b?si=c70cf352d67c4baf). I could go on like that through the whole album.

While the lead single [VULTURES], is nothing to write home about, it still features some of Kanye's best rapping on the whole album, has some menacing one liners from each feature, and an awesome Ty Dolla $ign back half of the track. While a lot of people complanined that this was chosen as the lead single, I actually didn't have too many problems with it.

[BURN]() was a song that landed well with everybody. Near perfect track with its only problem being that it was too short. Kanye had a vintage verse sandwhiched by an upbeat instrumental and a top-tier Ty Dolla hook. I also thought the Travis Scott feature on the back end of [FUK SUMN]() was one of the best moments on the whole album. Ty Dolla also had an awesome hook on that song and the production went super well with the well placed Playboi Carti feature. The same could be said with [CARNIVAL](), which some ridiculous vocal sampling and an underrated Ty Dolla verse.

From the day it dropped, [GOOD DON'T DIE] was by far my favorite song on the whole album. The sample, the instrumental, the vocals, the message, everything came together for a near flawless song. A couple days later, Kanye removed it off the album... which I think perfectly segways into the next section of this review.

### <u>The Bad</u>
I have to admit that I've probably overplayed this album a fair amount. I find more flaws through every listen. But I think that shows one of the biggest problems with the project as a whole. Once the excitement that my favorite artist dropped wears off, the reality sinks in: this is Kanye's worst album, easily. 

One of my biggest gripes with the whole album is Kanye's performance. His role as a producer and curator are great, but in terms of his role as a rapper and vocalist, this has got to be the worst I've ever heard Kanye. His vocals just don't hit like they do on other albums and I can't pinpoint exactly why. I think its a mix between the fact that the mixing on this album is a notch below what I'm used to, in addition to the fact that Kanye probably spent very little time putting effort into this actual artist performances. He sounds softer, and to be honest, more out of breath and unenthusiastic than I've ever heard him. Besides a few lines and flows here and there, he really did poopity scoop and closed on sunday'd his way through the whole album. From the papa johns line on the opener, to the roxanne crooning on paid, to the you know what on back to me, to the chipmunk business on fuk sumn. He pretty muched added cringe moment (or two) to about every song. 

If I really nitpick, I could find problems on every track. While I appreicated the experimentation on tracks like [HOODRAT]() and [PAPERWORK](), upon re-listen I've realized that these are really awful. I think [DO IT]() is one of the most unenthused  and empty songs I've hard in a long time and somebody completely forgot to add drums to [PROBLEMATIC](). The opening synths on [VULTURES] are so loud compared to the rest of the track that I jolt to the skip button every time it plays. I hate to admit it, but even [CARNIVAL]() has grown off of me, besides when I'm in the gym. Looking back to the listening parties, I actually perferred the original stripped back production, and Kanye's verse (or what we heard of it before the stream cut out) was <i>way</i>. While I still like [FUK SUMN]() a lot, the original versions that surfaced were just better, with the melody more present in the instrumental and a more layered base. The Quavo verse they took off also added to the song as well, but it got chopped for the chipmunk feature.

Looking at long-term replay value, I don't think this is a project I will come back to very much. It felt like a chore to listen through the album again while writing this review. While I added [BURN] to a few playlists and cycle [FUK SUMN] and [CARNIVAL] around in the gym, I'm not bumping this album again anytime soon. 

And why would I? Strip away recency bias: let's seriously compare VULTURES 1 to the rest of Kanye's discography. I saw some takes surfacing online that stated this was his best since TLOP. Are we kidding ourselves? This isn't even his best <i>collab album</i> since TLOP. Are people forgetting KIDS SEE GHOSTS happened? What about Ye and Jesus is King? DODNA?! I might be biased because all of these are some of my favorite albums ever and that was the period of time where I truly became I fan of Kanye, but its almost blasphemy to compare this album to DONDA. That's not even considering TLOP and all of the projects that preceded that, which are all certified CLASSICS. VULTURES 1 shouldn't even be mentioned in the same breath as the College Dropout or Yeezus. In my opinion, Kanye has the greatest discography in all of hip-hop, so yes, I hold his albums to a particular standard. If Ty Dolla $ign dropped this project as a solo album and Kanye took the back seat as executive producer it would be one thing, but VULTURES is a Kanye album and I have to hold it the the Kanye standard. Even compared to his unreleased projects, I've bumped Donda 2, Yandhi, and even Gods Country all more than Vultures and I prefer all of those projects substantially more.  

I could go on for longer, but hating on my favorite artist of all time is not something I like doing. But I think its important to voice critiques (if present) in an album review.

### <u>Overall thoughts</u>
While I was initially absolutely ecstatic to get a new Kanye album, I don't think I quite realized that it would like this. I wanted this album to be insane and I wanted this album so badly to meet my high expectations. I think these were unrealistic given everything that's happened to Kanye in the past year, in addition to the fact that now hes a completely independent artist. 

While Vultures 1 has its moments, its weighed down by some bad Kanye performances, production issues, and an overall messy execution. Comparing this to the rest of his discography, its by far and away his worst. I think its better off to view Kanye in a retirement phase, in which he shouldn't be held to the same Kanye standard we've all been spoiled with.
