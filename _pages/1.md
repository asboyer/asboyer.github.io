Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Aside from development, computer security, networking, and the IoT deeply interests me. I developed this curiosity by attending a two-week intensive cybersecurity summer camp at Syracuse University, which ended in a capture the flag hackathon. I've also started a business around teaching students the basics of computing and the Internet through a summer camp. Aside from summer camps, I also love to compete in virtual CTF competitions, and my team finished top 50th in the country in CMU's picoCTF 2021. Familiar with operating systems like Ubuntu and Kali Linux, and can adequately leverage command line technologies and tools.
