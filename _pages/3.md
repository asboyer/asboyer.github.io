My dedication to technological education extends beyond personal achievements, underscored by founding **CyberSummerCamp** to impart computer security knowledge to middle schoolers, and leading **RebootHacks**, a virtual hackathon that fosters innovation among high school students. Recognitions such as **Eagle Scout** and top placements in **picoCTF** highlight my leadership and technical skills. My overarching goal is to empower upcoming technologists through innovation, education, and a boundless curiosity about technology's capabilities.

**CyberSummerCamp** has been particularly meaningful to me, developing a curriculum that not only introduces cybersecurity fundamentals but also instills ethical responsibility and critical thinking in participants. This initiative reflects my early experiences and the significant impact that hands-on learning and mentorship can have on young minds. By creating an engaging and supportive learning environment, I aspire to spark a passion for technology and problem-solving, guiding students toward realizing their potential within the vast field of computer science.

Lastly, **RebootHacks** serves as another pillar of my commitment, offering high school students a platform to collaborate, innovate, and confront challenges directly. This event promotes creativity and teamwork, enabling participants to apply their coding skills to develop solutions for real-world problems. My involvement in organizing and mentoring at these hackathons has been both a means to contribute to the community and a valuable experience in leadership and event management. Through these efforts, I aim to foster a culture of continuous learning, innovation, and collaboration among aspiring technologists, envisioning a future where technology acts as a catalyst for positive change.
