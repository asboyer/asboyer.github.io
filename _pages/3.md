Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am always looking for an opportunity to lead, whether that be in the world of software, or elsewhere. Starting with computer science, I am the President of the Wayland Computer Science Club, where I lead the club in weekly meetings and help students pursue their passions in computer science. I am also the founder and lead organizer of Reboot Hacks, an organization that runs free hackathons for high schoolers. Our most recent event focused on creating software to assist with remote learning. Aside from computers, I am an Eagle Scout, and active member of the National Eagle Scout Association. In 2019, I led my Boy Scout troop in constructing a fully functional, weather-proof baseball scoreboard for our local Little League.
